I find it boring too:
Get up and take the remote at night
Get up and switch off the tv and ac 
I also find it boring to Do my homeworkk

The task i want to automate is 
Getting up and taking any thing so for that what i want to do is:

I will construct a robot which will listen to us 

For that i would use python
1 i will create an engine
2 i will give specific commands in the engine
3 there will be a binary language we will be speaking in with the robot
4 that binary language will be looped in my code
5 the binary language will be written on the robot;s hand manual
6 Your robot iss ready
